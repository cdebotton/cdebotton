## Oh, hello!

My name's Christian, I'm a sofrware engineer at [The Browser Company](https://thebrowser.company), working on [Arc](https://arc.net)! I'm currently living in the San Francisco Bay Area after three decades in New York City. I enjoy [taking pictures](https://www.instagram.com/cdebotton/) and traveling in my free time.

My professional focus has spanned UI engineering, backend services, and tooling, and I enjoy creative coding when I can.

In a past life I was a graphic designer and motion graphics animator.
