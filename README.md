## Oh, hello!

My name's Christian, I'm a Senior Principal Engineer on the Developer Platform team at Vimeo. Before going remote and moving to the Bay Area, I was an Engineering Manager for product and platform teams at Vimeo HQ in NYC. I enjoy [taking pictures](https://www.instagram.com/cdebotton/) and traveling in my free time.

My professional focus has spanned UI engineering, backend services, and tooling, and I enjoy creative coding when I can.

In a past life I was a graphic designer and motion graphics animator.
